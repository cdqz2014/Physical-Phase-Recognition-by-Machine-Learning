#Visualization
Comput and draw all the magnetization of training set to visualize the phase transition structure.

This code is just for data checking and not related to our main tasks that I roughly wrote it half-month ago. 

```python
python "Reading and Visualization.py"
```

Unfortunately, due to change of lattice sizes, this code does not work anymore 2333...
