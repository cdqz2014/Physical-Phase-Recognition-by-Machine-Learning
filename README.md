## High/Low-temperature Phase Recognition by Fully-Connected Model

- Data (already in equilibrium), both for *training set* and *test set*, are all generated by **Monte Carlo simulation** (cf. *Notes of Computational Physics* by 丁泽军)
- Basic structure: 
    - Input layer is the **flattened** configuration of spins.
    - Effective Shallow NN
        - Layer one has merely three neurons, explained as **high-T phase**, **low-T phase**, and **critical phase**, and excited by ```Relu```. 
        - Output layer has merely one neuron, excited by ```Sigmoid```.
    - Brute Forced Deep NN
        - Layer one has 10 neurons, excited by ```Relu```.
        - Layer two has 5 neurons, excited by ```Relu```.
        - Output layer has 2 neurons, explained as **high-T phase** and **low-T phase** excited by ```Sigmoid```.

## Add CNN for higher Recognition Performance
- (Not finished yet, actually I wonder if this is necessary 2333...)

## Unsupervied Learning to distinguish high-T and Low-T phases
- **k-means** Algorithm

## Note

All codes are checked on my **Archlinux** but **not on Windows**, and since I invoke many system-related commands (```os``` package), so there must be many fatal errors if you run them on windows.
